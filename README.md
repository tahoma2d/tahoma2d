## What is Tahoma2D Quirinux Tweaks?

**Tahoma2D Quirinux Tweaks** is a modified version of Tahoma2D, a 2D and stop motion animation software. 
Unlike the original version, our fork incorporates little modifications tailored to the animation workflow of Charlie Mart√≠nez's animation studio. These tweaks, developed with the studio's specific needs in mind, are later incorporated into the packages of the **Quirinux GNU/Linux** distribution.

The original Tahoma2D is based on Toonz Studio Ghibli Version, which was originally developed in Italy by [Digital Video, Inc.](https://web.archive.org/web/20230331180319/http://www.toonz.com/), Inc. and later customized by [ Studio Ghibli](http://www.ghibli.jp/) over many years of production.

It is important to note that this is an **unofficial version** of the software. Both the **Tahoma2D** and **OpenToonz** trademarks belong to their respective owners. This repository has no official backing from them, although occasionally some of our modifications may be integrated into the original Tahoma2D code.

## Program Requirements

The package in .deb format created for Quirinux can be run on computers with a 64-bit processor and at least 1 GB of RAM (sufficient for stop motion animation). It's compatible with Debian based distributions.
