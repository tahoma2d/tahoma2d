Tahoma2D uses a modified version of libgphoto2.

- Windows version was modified to allow building with MSVC 2019 using a modified
  MSVC project taken from https://github.com/vividos/RemotePhotoTool.

- OSX version was modified to allow relocation of camlib/iolibs directories relative
  to libgphoto2/libgphoto2_port dylibs, post build, to allow for packaging and portability.

- Linux version has no changes

Modified source can be found at https://github.com/tahoma2d/libgphoto2 under 
the `tahoma2d-version` branch.
