<h4>● Overview</h4>
Allows to generate a motion parallax movement effect on the Source image, where things in<br>
front move faster than things in the back.<br>
The image width is stretched to the sides, to transform it into a trapezoid, but it will not<br>
be stretched vertically.<br>
In other words, the contraction in the vertical direction caused by depth, should be<br>
incorporated beforehand in the image.<br>
Also, if you want to apply this effect to a moving background, the movement of the background<br>
must be collapsed into a SubXsheet.<br><br>

<h4>● Input Port</h4>
<UL>
<LI><b>Source</b> : Connect the input image.</LI>
</UL>

<h4>● Parameters</h4>
<UL>
<LI><b>Vanishing Point</b> : The center point for the deformation. In the case of perspective<br>
projection, this is the vanishing point.</LI>
<LI><b>Anchor Point</b> : Defines the vertical position that will be the basis for the deformation.<br>
Pixels above this point will not be drawn (become transparent).<br>
It also defines the horizon line for the deformed image, maintaining the original image width.</LI>
<LI><b>Precision</b> : Since the deformation is carried out only by expansion, the resolution will<br>
suffer. In order to minimize resolution deterioration, the original image resolution is<br>
multiplied by this value before being deformed.<br>
There is no point in making Precision higher than the value obtained by dividing the<br>
"Capture resolution of the background" by the "Output resolution".</LI>
