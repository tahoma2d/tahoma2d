<h4>● Overview</h4>
This effect reproduces a camera lens blur. The RGB values of each layer will be converted<br>
to exposure values, then blurred using the Iris shape, and finally composed together.<br>
To achieve a faster processing time, a Fourier transformation is used to process the filter.

<h4>● Input Port</h4>
<UL>
<LI><b>Iris</b> : Connects the image to define the shape of the Iris. The image luminance<br>
values will be used for the effect. If no image is connected to the Iris port, no calculation<br>
will take place. It's possible to connect 8bit or 16bit RGBA images.
<LI><b>Source [1～5]</b> : Connects images for the layers. The order in which they are<br>
connected here doesn't define the layer stacking order. If nothing is connected to any<br>
Source port, no calculation will be performed.
</UL>

<h4>● Parameters</h4>
Common
<UL>
<LI><b>On-Focus Distance</b> : If there's a layer in this position, it will look on focus and it will be<br>
composed normally. 0 represents the camera position. (Range 0.0-1.0)
<LI><b>Bokeh Amount</b> : Maximum size of blur (in scene units). When the focus position and the<br>
layer position are 1.0 away from each other and Bokeh Adjustment is 1, the Iris image is<br>
enlarged until the width of this image reaches this value.
<LI><b>Hardness</b> : The gamma value of the film. Used to convert between RGB value and<br>
exposure. This is equivalent to the increase in RGB value (0.0 to 1.0) when the exposure is<br>
increased 10 times. The lower the value, the more the highlights are emphasized.<br>
(Range 0.05-3.0)
</UL>
Sources
<UL>
<LI><b>Distance</b> : The distance of the layer from the camera. The layer stacking order is<br>
automatically sorted according to this value. (Range 0.0-1.0)
<LI><b>Bokeh Adjustment</b> : Bokeh size correction value. The size of the bokeh is multiplied by N,<br>
keeping the order of layer stacking. If this value is 0, the layers will be composited normally<br>
without blurring regardless of the distance of the layer. (Range 0.0-2.0)
</UL>

<h4>● Notes</h4>
<UL>
<LI>When rendering multiple frames, the Iris and the layers images, must be present within<br>
the range of all frames to be rendered.
<LI>This effect uses a lot of RAM.
</UL>

<h4>● License Information</h4>
<UL>
<LI>This effect uses an open source library called Kiss FFT for the Fourier transform.<br>
