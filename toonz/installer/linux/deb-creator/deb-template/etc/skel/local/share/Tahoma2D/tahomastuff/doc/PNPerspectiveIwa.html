<h4>● Overview</h4>
This effect generates a deep Perlin noise pattern on a horizontal plane.<br>
In addition to the normal noise pattern, there is a mode for outputting as an offset reference image<br>
for the WarpHVIno effect, and a mode for outputting the Fresnel reflection intensity of the water surface<br>
as seen from the camera, when the noise pattern is the water surface wave height.

<h4>● Parameters</h4>
<UL>
<LI><b>Mode</b> : Specify drawing mode. There is a choice of the 4 following modes:</LI>
	<UL>
	<LI><I>Noise</I> : Draws a Perlin noise pattern. The noise value is calculated for each sampling<br>
	point obtained by dividing 1 pixel into 100.</LI>
	<LI><I>Noise (no resampled)</I> : Draws a Perlin noise pattern. Subpixel processing is not performed<br>
	and results are obtained at high speed, but the noise pattern near the horizon is irregular.</LI>
	<LI><I>Warp HV offset</I> : When the noise pattern is set to the level of the water surface, the red<br>
	or green channel is drawn to show how much the light reflected by the water surface is in the<br>
	horizontal or vertical direction.<br>
	By connecting to the WarpHVIno effect's "Hori" and "Vert" ports, you can reproduce the distortion of<br>
	the reflected water surface. You can adjust the shade of the pattern with the "Wave Height" parameter<br>
	described below.<br>
	*Since the WarpHVIno effect port refers by default to the Red channel for both "Hori" and "Vert", channel<br>
	conversion is required on the "Vert" port side, using Channel Selector effect.</LI>
	<LI><I>Fresnel reflectivity</I> : When the noise pattern is high or low on the water surface, the Fresnel<br>
	reflection intensity of the water surface as seen from the camera is output in shades. The reflected<br>
	intensity at the bottom of the camera frame is normalized and displayed as 0 brightness. You can adjust<br>
	the shade of the pattern with the "Wave Height" parameter described below.</LI>
	
</UL>
<LI><b>Size</b> : Specify the size of the main random pattern.</LI>
<LI><b>Evolution</b> : Specify the expansion of the main random pattern.</LI>
<LI><b>Octaves</b> : Specify how many levels of random pattern to synthesize.</LI>
<LI><b>Offset</b> : Specify the offset position of the first random pattern.<br>
The right direction of the camera is positive on the X axis, and the back direction of the camera is positive on<br>
the Y axis.</LI>
<LI><b>p_Intensity</b> : Specify the pattern intensity ratio, between the current generation and the next<br>
generation.</LI>
<LI><b>p_Size</b> : OSpecify the pattern size ratio, between the current generation and the next generation.</LI>
<LI><b>p_Evolution</b> : Specify the ratio of the pattern evolution period, between the current generation and the next<br>
generation.</LI>
<LI><b>p_Offset</b> : Specify the pattern offset ratio, between the current generation and the next generation.</LI>
<LI><b>Fov</b> : Specify the vertical angle of view of the camera in degrees.<br>
When the angle of view is large, the perspective is emphasized (wide angle), and when the angle of view is<br>
small, the perspective is compressed (telephoto).</LI>
<LI><b>Eye Level</b> : Specify the vanishing point (Horizon line) position of the camera.</LI>
<LI><b>Alpha Rendering</b> : Specifies whether the noise intensity value is also stored in the Alpha channel.</LI>
<LI><b>Wave Height</b> : When the noise pattern is the height of the water surface, specify the difference in wave<br>
height between the maximum and minimum noise positions.<br>
Valid only for "Warp HV offset" and "Fresnel reflectivity" modes.</LI>
