## Notice about modified Qt

 If you are using Windows version of OpenToonz installed from the installer 
 provided from OpenToonz website (https://opentoonz.github.io/), Qt libraries 
 distributed with the software may be our customized version. 
 The other OS versions (macOS, Linux) are not the case. 


### To check whether the Qt libraries are customized.
