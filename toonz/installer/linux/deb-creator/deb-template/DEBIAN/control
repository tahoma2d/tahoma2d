Description: Tahoma 2D Version 1.5.1
 Original author: Jeremy Bullock
 .
 Tahoma2D is developed by Jeremy Bullock, a middle school teacher in Colorado. Tahoma2D is based on OpenToonz which itself is based on Toonz, developed by Digital Video in Italy.
 .
 The mission of Tahoma2D is to be a powerful and user-friendly animation program for digital 2D artists and stop motion animators.
 .
 Tahoma2D is mostly open source, but in order to support Canon cameras, we use the Canon proprietary SDK. Tahoma2D can be built without the SDK, however.
