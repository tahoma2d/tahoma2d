Description: Tahoma 2D Version 1.5.2
 Tahoma2D is a 2D and stop motion animation software. 
 .
 It is a fork of OpenToonz which is based on Toonz Studio Ghibli Version, originally developed in Italy by Digital Video, Inc., and customized by Studio Ghibli over many years of production.
 .
 Tahoma2D is mostly open source, but in order to support Canon cameras, we use the Canon proprietary SDK. Tahoma2D can be built without the SDK, however.
